Undirected Graphs:
    * An undirected graph G=(V,E) consists of:
      - A set V of nodes (objects we are interested in)
      - A set E of edges representing connections between
        nodes.

    * Example (A graph consists of two sets):
          G = (V, E)
          V = {A, B, C, D} : Nodes
          E = {{A, B}, {A, C}, {A, D},
               {B, D}} : Edges

    * A path in a graph G=(V,E) is a sequence of nodes
        (n1, n2, ..., nk)
      such that n1, ..., nk ∈ V and {ni, ni+1}∈E, for i=1, ..., k-1
    * The Length of a path is the number of edges it contains
      i.e number of nodes less one (minus one))

Cycle:
    A cycle in a graph G=(V,E) is a path containing at least
    two nodes that starts and ends at the same node and which
    never uses an edge more than once.

Acyclic:
    A graph that contains no cycles is called an acyclic graph

Graph Problems:
    * Reach-ability: is there a path from one node to another
    * Shortest path between two nodes
    * Does the graph have a cycle?
    * Can you split the graph into disjoint paths?
    * etc.etc
